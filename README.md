# Project name & pitch

**Todo app** <br />
The "Todo app" was created to better organize your time. It allows us to add a due date for the task, set the priority and counts already completed. The application connects to the MongoDB Atlas database and the backend itself was written using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.
